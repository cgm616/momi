Jewish identity and the lives of Jewish people are complex, so my interviewee's responses to my questions were multifaceted.
We can examine them from a number of different angles.
I have given each angle its own page below, where I collected quotes from my interviewees alongside analysis of what they said.

In the same vein, the interviewees sometimes had similar experiences, which I have grouped together.
When two interviewees shared a certain type of experience — such as getting married, going to elementary school, or attending college — their words are collected together for easy comparison.

**There is no right or wrong way to explore the topics.** Feel free to skim a bunch or sit down with one for a longer read. When you move to a new page, your audio will continue to play without interruption.

If you need a reason to stay, consider the following testimonial:

    What a cool thing, Coley!
{% end %}
