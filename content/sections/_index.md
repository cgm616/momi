Jewish identity and the lives of Jewish people are complex, so my interviewee's responses to my questions were multifaceted.
We can examine them from a number of different angles.
I have given each angle its own page below, where I collected quotes from my interviewees alongside analysis of what they said.

In the same vein, the interviewees sometimes had similar experiences, such as going to college or starting a career.
Though I have not collected these into their own pages, I urge you to go to the transcripts and search for keywords that you are interested in.
All three of these people have lived full, varied lives, and their experiences are interesting.
For example, what was it like for Lara to be Jewish in elementary school?
Or what did Gabe do after graduating high school?
Their stories are compelling and provide insight into their conceptions of Jewish identity and their interactions with the Jewish experience.
If you cannot find something in my analysis below, it is most likely in [the transcripts](@/transcripts/_index.md).

**There is no right or wrong way to explore the topics.** Feel free to skim a bunch or sit down with one for a longer read. When you move to a new page, your audio will continue to play without interruption.

If you need a reason to stay, consider the following testimonial (and try clicking the timestamp to hear Ellen say the quote):

{% quote(name="Ellen", millis=6505200, anchor=6505470) %}
    What a cool thing, Coley!
{% end %}
