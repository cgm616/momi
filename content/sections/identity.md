Two of my interviewees expressed that Jewish identity consisted of more than [religion](@/sections/going-to-synagogue.md), but varied in the strength of their convictions.
The third, Ellen, was insistent on a the solely religious Judaism.
However, all three described Jewish identity in an *unstable* manner.
By this, I mean that they often expressed a lack of certain knowledge, allowed for other understandings of Jewishness than their own, and seemed stuck between multiple ideas of Jewish identity.
Note carefully that I do not mean to say that their understandings of Jewish identity were wrong or somehow bad.
Instead, I only seek to highlight that they expressed insecurity and uncertainty about the ways Jewishness exists in the same manner that Judaism has long escaped an easy definition.{{ footnote(keys="gonzalez-lesserJewishnessSuiGeneris2020") }}

The most dogmatic understanding of Jewish identity was Ellen's.
Numerous times through our interview, she said emphatically that "Judaism is a religion."
For Ellen, Judaism is not a "nationality" or "race."
Key to her understanding was that there are many different Jews, and that anyone who wanted to could become Jewish.
This assertion perhaps harks back to her own search for religious community as an adult: she was able to choose Judaism as much as she could have chosen to be a Quaker or Unitarian Universalist.
In particular, she draws a distinction between the categories of 'Jewish American' and 'Asian American.'

{% quote(name="Ellen",millis=5935000,anchor=5798750) %}
I mean, Jewish is a religion. You know, it's not— like if you say Asian Americans, that's different. You know, that's not a religion. Like you have— you have African Jews, you have Spanish Jews, you know, you've got German Jews, you've got Austrian Jews, you've got Jews in Nigeria, you've got Jews in India.
{% end %}

Considering the post-World War 2 shift away from racial characterizations of Judaism, Ellen's insistence that Judaism is a religion is unsurprising.{{ footnote(keys="glennBloodConsentDescent2002",pages="146") }}
However, modern day DNA tests through a wrench into that conception of Judaism by claiming that somehow, Jewishness is in our cells.
Ellen pushed back against the logic of DNA tests, which she had taken and which said that she was Jewish.

{% quote(name="Ellen",millis=5961888,anchor=5798750) %}
You know, it's— it's not a nationality, even though Ancestry.com [a DNA testing service] says it is, which is weird, I think.
{% end %}

Though she said "nationality," more common terms for what tests like Ancestry.com might reveal are (biologized) ethnicity, genetics, and heritage.
When genetic tests reveal data like a person's percentage of "Ashkenazi DNA," they traffic in imprecision around what they mean, "sometimes conflating racial, ethnic, national, regional, or continental categories."{{ footnote(keys="foxJewishGeneticPotency2020",pages="69") }}
However, in her choice of words, it's possible to discern another possible cause for Ellen's uncomfortability with non-religious understandings of Judaism.
A common anti-Semitic trope is dual loyality: the idea that Jews are loyal to the Jewish nation, whatever that may be, rather than the nations in which they reside.
Though genetic material cannot provide any information on nationality, particularly in racially and ethnically diverse places like the United States, Ellen's rejection of DNA tests is seemingly based on worries about what it means for Judaism to be a nationality. 

Despite her own past, where she specifically chose to be religiously Jewish, and her insistence that Judaism is a religion, Ellen acknowledges that there is something more to Judaism.
In some ways, her own identity was like that of the second generation Jews outlined by Herbert Gans, who "could actually envisage no alternatives to being Jewish" and whose "Jewishness was similarly submerged and unconscious, entirely beyond the realm of choice."{{ footnote(keys="gansAmericanJewryPresent1956",pages="426") }}
When asked if the fact that her parents were Jewish influenced her own Jewish identity, she said that it probably had, although not from the point of view of genetics, descent, or heritage.
Instead, she used cultural terms to describe Judaism's attractiveness for her (though her words can be understand in both ethnic and religious lights).

{% quote(name="Ellen",millis=4684000,anchor=4680800) %}
I mean, [Judaism is] a shared set of values and tradition that I always felt was important to keep that thread. Whatever it was.
{% end %}

Later, however, when asked if Judaism is more than a religion, Ellen compared Jewish Americans to Italian Americans.
While she qualified her statement by saying that most religions had cultures attached, she likened the feeling of being in a synagogue or around other Jewish people with the feeling of a Black person at a historically Black college or university.
These comparisons suggest that Ellen's view of Judaism as solely a religion is not necessarily absolute.
Instead, Judaism for Ellen might include conceptions of community, social life, and culture that transcend essentialized, Western ideas of religion.

On the other hand, Lara accepted the DNA test logic of Jewishness in the blood.
In fact, she drew a comparison between Judaism and other "religions" because of Judaism's ethnic characteristics.
Though she oscillates between using the word "nationality" and the word "ethnicity" to describe the complexity she sees in Judaism, she is clear that there is more to Jewish identity than religion.

{% quote(name="Lara",millis=1137008,anchor=1108900) %}
I also think that being Jewish, there is like a certain complexity to it that there aren't— that there isn't in most other religions that I know of, in that it is both a religion and— and, I— what is it? It's not a nationality? It's not an ethnicity? Is it an ethnicity? Yeah. Eh, I don't know! It's in my blood. (laughing) Like you take the DNA test, it tells you you're Jewish. That's not— doesn't tell you you're Christian. It's like a slightly different thing. So I was— (laughing) I knew I was Jewish without needing to be religiously Jewish.
{% end %}

However, her belief in so-called "blood logic" is even more clear only a few sentences later.{{ footnote(keys="glennBloodConsentDescent2002") }}
Lara's Jewish identity is an "absolute" truth, while her Jewish religiosity is less well-defined.
Since Lara's ancestors are Jewish, she says that she is too.
According to her, she is Jewish at very least "in the way that" she is Scottish, and she is confident in that identity.
In the future, despite her many questions about Judaism as a faith, she hopes to look into what it means to be religiously Jewish.

Curiously, Lara "realized" that she was Jewish in middle school when she realized that she had an identity.

{% quote(name="Lara",millis=270800,anchor=268380) %}
I also don't think that I knew I was Jewish in elementary school. But I knew it in middle school. (laughing) [...] in middle school, you start talking about your identity because you start to realize that you have one, which is a fun and difficult time.
{% end %}

Unlike Ellen, Lara firmly believes that Judaism is not simply a religion.
Gabe agrees with Lara, though his characterizations are somewhat less specific.
For Gabe, Judaism is a set of cultural practices along with ethnicity and religion.
Shared life experiences make up a large part of what it means to be Jewish for him.

{% quote(name="Gabe",millis=5698520,anchor=5698520) %}
Like [when] we go to Passover, [...] I love the fact that there are millions of Jews doing that across the globe.
{% end %}

For Gabe, being Jewish involves being part of "one family tree."
He appreciates and enjoys how Judaism involves shared descent, though he does not exclude conversionary Jews from his definition of who is Jewish.
In fact, Gabe celebrates the process and ritual of being and becoming a Jew — what you learn and experience is part of Jewish identity for him.

Like Lara, Gabe says that there is a religious Judaism in which he partakes less.
He also says that he wish he had more access to the cultural parts of Judaism, which for him include bagels and lox, traditional Ashkenazi foods.

Another marker of Judaism for Gabe is informal Jewish community, which neither Lara nor Ellen mentioned.
Gabe enjoys how being Jewish shapes his life even in spaces, like the workplace, that are not specifically Jewish.
For instance, he spoke about having Jewish friends at work who would exchange good wishes around Jewish holidays.
Rather than Judaism-as-community in a formal sense, such as [attending synagogue](@/sections/going-to-synagogue.md), Gabe appreciated informal bonds in atypical places.

All three participants responded that they were white when I asked.
